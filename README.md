# smart-contracts
A collection of smart contracts for ethereum.

## Getting Started
1. Install Truffle. Truffle is the development environment for blockchains on ethereum. It is used for compiling, deploying, and testing your smart contracts.

> `npm install -g truffle`

2. Install and Run Gananche. Go to the truffle website to download. Ganache is a personal ethereum blockchain ran locally to deploy/test your contracts against.

## Useful Commands

Compiles the smart contracts located in the contracts directory.

> `truffle migrate`
